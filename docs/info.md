## How it works

This project implements a simple 8-bit adder using the ui_in and uio_in input buses. The adder computes the sum of the two 8-bit inputs and outputs the lower 8 bits of the result to uo_out. If there is an overflow (i.e., a carry out from the 8th bit), it is indicated on uio_out[0].

## How to test

Connect 8-bit input A to the ui_in pins.

Connect 8-bit input B to the uio_in pins.

Read the result of the addition on the uo_out pins.

Check uio_out[0] for the carry-out (overflow) bit â€” it will be 1 if the result exceeds 8 bits.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required.
